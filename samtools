#To get the usage(manual) for the samtools view tool, run the following command:
samtools view

#Before using samtools view, you might have to install an updated version of samtools first by using the command:
conda install -c bioconda samtools=1.13

#Newer versions are also available on github
#In the manual, you find the option, -c, which can tell you the number of records (alignments) in our sample data files. Usage:
#samtools view [options] || [region...]
#From this usage, we can see the command syntax is:
#samtools view [options] <filename>

#open text editor
nano samtools.sh

#In Bash script, start with the shebang

#!/usr/bin/env bash

#enable debugging with the set command to track errors
set -eu

#Use a for loop to return the number of records (alignments)
for file in *.bam
do

#check if file is empty using the -s option
if [[ -s "${file}" ]]
then

#useful message to show process
echo "Processing: ${file}"

#count number of alignments in said file using samtools view
alignments=$(samtools view -c ${file})

#print file name (BTW, this is optional)
echo ${file}

#print result of samtools view count
echo ${alignments}
fi
done
